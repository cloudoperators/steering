# CloudOperators Charter

## Mission Statement
We aim to simplify and secure the operation of globally distributed bare-metal operating system through a unified, transparent, and extensible managed service platform. Greenhouse empowers teams by reducing operations complexity, standardizing configurations, and delivering built-in observability, security, and compliance solutions—enabling organizations to run their cloud environments efficiently, confidently, and sustainably.

## Project Description
Greenhouse is a comprehensive platform designed to address the challenges of operating large-scale cloud infrastructures.  
It offers a holistic dashboard and API to manage various operational aspects efficiently and transparently. Moreover, it enables operations of a globally distributed cloud infrastructure in compliance with industry standards. The platform addresses common operational challenges such as the complexity of tools, fragmentation of configuration, visibility and permission management.
Several plugins extend the core platform, providing cloud-native observability, security & compliance tooling and more. These plugins come with sane default configurations and include all necessary components for application-specific needs such as production-proven alerts, playbooks, metric visualization dashboards.

## Benefit to NeoNephos

The cloud-edge continuum requires physical hardware which can be housed in centralized, secure data centers or in more compact form factor at near and far edges, all with appropriate energy supply (preferably renewable) and cooling.   
Alongside the physical setup of cloud and edge locations, a software system is essential for managing this hardware - the Baremetal Operating System (BOS). The BOS is designed to create a stable and robust foundation that seamlessly integrates with the Cloud Operating System (COS). As spending on cloud infrastructure services continues to grow, BOS aims to facilitate an easily reproducible, fully automated, and end-to-end lifecycle for compute, storage, and network hardware from build to decommissioning. In addition to documentation, BOS will provide a reference implementation on qualified hardware, allowing companies to join the continuum.

BOS extends the traditional definition of machine-centric Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) by operationalizing and combining cloud-native concepts with robust and known open-source components. It is primarily provided via projects IronCore and CobaltCore, whereas other projects assist with its production-grade monitoring and operations.

# Benefits to Project

1. Visibility and credibility
Being accepted into a foundation signals maturity and open governance. It gives the project a stamp of approval that builds trust with users, contributors, and companies. It also increases visibility through the foundation’s events, website, and communication channels.


2. Community growth
Foundations help projects attract more contributors by connecting them to a larger ecosystem. Collaboration becomes easier, and it’s more likely that the project will get code contributions, bug reports, documentation help, and broader adoption.


3. Neutral governance
The project is no longer controlled by a single company or individual. A foundation provides a neutral home with shared decision-making and technical steering, which is important for long-term sustainability and fairness.


4. Easier adoption
Companies are more likely to adopt foundation-hosted projects because they are seen as stable, vendor-neutral, and well-maintained. Being part of an ecosystem of related projects also makes integration and deployment easier.


5. Technical and infrastructure support
Foundations often provide services like CI/CD pipelines, security audits, and release infrastructure. This lets the maintainers focus more on development and less on operations.


6. Roadmap alignment and standards
Foundations encourage transparent development processes, open roadmaps, and alignment with broader industry standards. This helps keep the project relevant and interoperable with others.
